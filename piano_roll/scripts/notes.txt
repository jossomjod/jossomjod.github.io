NEW NEW PIANO ROLL IDEA:

You click somewhere to place the note start.

It's a draggable circle which determines at what time and pitch the note should start.

A short line goes from the note start to the note end, which is marked by another circle.

You can drag said circle to a different time, and also a different pitch.

Clicking on the line adds another draggable circle for further manipulating the note before the end.

The pitch follows the line.

Right-clicking on the line shows a context menu where a function can be selected
for making the line smoother.


Later circles cannot be moved to an earlier time than the earlier ones.

Moving an earlier circle past a later one will push the later circle to the same time.
  OR: Any later circle will match the movements of the one you are dragging.
  ^^ Tested; sucks.

Right-clicking a circle will remove it.

Removing the start or end circle will remove the entire note (every circle which is part of the note).

If multiple circles are in the same place, ... GoOd LuCk.
jk, just drag one out of the way.

Scrolling will scroll. Yep. Or maybe zoom. Idk. MAYBE BOTH. wooooooooooooo.
Actually, scrolling on the piano-roll will zoom everything.
Scrolling on a rectangle will zoom only that one.


Middle-click-and-drag will pan around the entire piano roll.

You can select multiple notes and make changes to all of them at the same time.


Idea: Make the circles change size based on how close the cursor is.
      Bigger circles are easier to grab, smaller circles look better.




There are different modes for the piano roll, showing different parameters in the y-axis.

You can switch between modes at any time using number keys.

In pitch mode, a circle's y-coordinate represents the pitch of that part of the note.

In volume mode, a circle's y-coordinate represents the volume of that part of the note.

In panner mode... Well, you get the idea.

There's also an up/down panner mode, and a forward/backward panner mode, because why the fuck not?

Or maybe all the panning can be done in one mode?
Numbers? Multiple sliders near each circle?
A large circle popping up around the one you last clicked on, with an extra draggable circle for panning?



Or maybe...
Instead of changing the entire pianoroll to another mode:

Double-click on a circle to display a semi-transparent rectangle covering the entire note.
Start and end circles with a line between them are shown in the rectangle.
Adding, removing, and moving circles inside the rectangle works the same way as in the rest of the pianoroll.

OR: Actually change the pianoroll mode, but leave the pitch mode visible (but faint, greyed out).
    And do the rectangle idea, but show every rectangle.

OR: Double-click on a circle to change automation values for that circle.
	This would work well with panning. Maybe.





Anyway, the idea is to make it easier and more fun to manually control every note.

Because that's how you make good, unique music. I think.

This is kind of like having a unique synth for every note, but all in one note editor.



A saving system.

Needs a way to change size of pianoroll. At least the width.

I should keep prototyping the pianoroll.
No point coming up with more ideas until I know more.



FOR THE REST OF THE DAW----------------------------------------
===============================================================


There are instrument tracks which contain effects.

In the tracks you can place note clips, which can be edited in the piano roll.

The effects will affect any clips in their tracks. Duh.

Clips consist of circles which can be added, removed, or dragged into other tracks.

If a clip has a start circle in one track and ends in another, the sound will change smoothly.
This is possible because different tracks still share the same kind of effects, even if the
initial settings are different.

The various parameters will change smoothly from those of one track to the other.


Parts of multiple tracks can be selected simultaneously.

If effect parameters of a track are edited while a part is selected, parameters will be automated
to the chosen values only in the selected part.


Instead, just like with the piano editor, the track thingy has modes.

Switch to a different mode to see effect automation stuff on top of clips.
You know, circles with lines between them.

I guess some effects would need to have their parameters set in a dedicated ui.
Then automation stuff could determine the strength of the effect. Maybe.

NOTE COLORS:
You have an active color.
You can switch between active colors at any time by pressing the key you assigned to that color.
Notes you place have the color that was active when you placed them.
Only notes of the current active color can be edited.
Notes of inactive colors are visible, but partly faded into the background.
