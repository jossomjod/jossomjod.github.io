TODO:
- modulate/carry input    DONE
- pitch automation        DONE
- web component: a number input you can drag to adjust       DONE
  - different rates of change depending on horizontal mouse pos maybe? Experiment.
	- maybe drag the left side for BIG changes, right side for small, middle for medium?
	- right/left/middle click and drag?
	- modifier keys?
- LOW FUCKING PASS OILY JOSH
- and we gotta hmmmm make AM multiplicative duh


WE NEED SMALLER VALUES
Tiny changes make a big difference with FM synthesis.
DONE

hmmmmm
i forgor

ok, yeah
we need to give better feedback on what the custom number input is doing
and also fix it so it works better

In FL studio you modify the clicked digit when you click and drag.
Just check the x coordinate onclick and do some math to account for font size maybe?

note manager TODOs:
- fix endlessly playing note bug
- automation
  - per note
	  - should initially be based on the synth envelopes
	- per track
	  - it should be possible to choose a default value to use when playing on the keyboard
		- when moving a note, the preview sound should go through the effect with the value at the note start time
	- global
	  - bpm, master gain


====== BUGS ======

- notes sometimes get stuck and play endlessly when playing on the keyboard
  - never happens in Firefox, happens often in Chrome and Edge
	- steps to reproduce:
	  - press key -> press other key -> release first key while still holding second key
	- releasing the first key causes the second key to be pressed again wtf???
	- https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40940886
	- FIXED by workaround


- some synth parameter inputs show incorrect values when loading a save or switching tracks
  - affects jodnumb and detune (but not coarse)
