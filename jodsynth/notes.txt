TODO:
- modulate/carry input    DONE
- pitch automation        DONE
- web component: a number input you can drag to adjust       DONE
  - different rates of change depending on horizontal mouse pos maybe? Experiment.
	- maybe drag the left side for BIG changes, right side for small, middle for medium?
	- right/left/middle click and drag?
	- modifier keys?
- and we gotta hmmmm make AM multiplicative duh
- moving an envelope node horizontally should also move all nodes after it



note manager TODOs:
- automation
  - per note
	  - should initially be based on the synth envelopes
		- we will very often want the same pitch automation applied to all oscillators
		- copying selected notes should instead copy automation
		- pasting should paste automation into selected note
	- per track
	  - it should be possible to choose a default value to use when playing on the keyboard
		- when moving a note, the preview sound should go through the effect with the value at the note start time
	- global
	  - bpm, master gain
- global fx
  - compressor
- note/synth fx with envelope and automation
  - filter
- sidechain fx
  - trigger fx gain envelope on note start


====== BUGS ======

- notes sometimes get stuck and play endlessly when playing on the keyboard
  - never happens in Firefox, happens often in Chrome and Edge
	- steps to reproduce:
	  - press key -> press other key -> release first key while still holding second key
	- releasing the first key causes the second key to be pressed again wtf???
	- https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40940886
	- FIXED by workaround

- Chrome refuses to emit a keyup event every other time you press the Â¨^~ key (Physical: "RightBracket")

- grid renders bar and octave lines wrong when panned to negative coords (positive scroll values)
