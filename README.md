# My website
It's basically just a list of a few of the things I have made.

Try it [here](https://jossomjod.github.io/index.html).

The license specified in the file named "LICENSE" only applies to the code, not the content.
By "content" I mean anything that is not code, such as videos, images, music, etc.
No license is given for any of the content.
