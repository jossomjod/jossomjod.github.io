It's just a bunch of shaders made with webGL.

Use the number keys to switch between different shaders.

## Shaders:
1. Four pulsating, color-changing balls of light moving around.
2. Just a rotating cone of light.
3. A bunch of bouncing balls of light. Might look like a helix with ambiguous rotation.
4. A pulsating, color-changing ball of light surrounded by a ring of smaller balls.
5. A circle of glowing balls centered on the cursor. They warp depending on mouse position. Try pressing a mouse button.
