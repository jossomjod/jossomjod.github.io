	<p>This page is a work in progress. It is supposed to contain my portfolio.<br>
	Here is some stuff I have made:</p>

			<h2>#2: A unique piano roll for making music.</h2>
			<p>Instead of traditional notes there are pitch automation nodes (represented by circles connected by lines). A single note can have many automation nodes.<br>
			The idea is to allow automating synth- and effect parameters for individual notes. Technically, you <i>can</i> do this in most existing DAWs, but you'd have to create a bunch of extra tracks, most of them with only a few notes each, and to make changes and additions you would have to scroll a hundred miles and click through a thousand menus.
			</p>
			<p>NOTE: This is an old prototype. It lacks many common features, such as saving/loading, undo/redo, etc, and there are known bugs. This prototype has served its purpose and will not be further developed.</p>
			<p><b>Instructions:</b></p>
			<p>Left-click on empty space to place a note. Notes consist of two or more nodes (circles) connected by lines. Left-click on a line to add a new node.<br>
			Left-click and drag to move a circle. The largest circle of a note moves the entire note.<br>
			Right-click on a node to delete it. Deleting an end-node deletes the entire note.<br>
			Press Space to play/stop.<br>
			Press Ctrl+Space to play from wherever the mouse cursor is.<br>
			Press 1 to switch to pitch automation mode (default)<br>
			Press 2 to switch to volume automation mode.<br>
			Press G to toggle snap to grid.<br>
			Press V to toggle only the vertical grid snapping.<br>
			Press H to toggle only the horizontal grid snapping.</p>

			<h2>#3: Tic-Tac-Two</h2>
			<p>It's like tic-tac-toe, but better.<br>
			Instead of placing new crosses or circles until someone wins, you place only three pieces each, then keep moving them, one by one, to new positions, until someone wins.<br>A simple rule-change that makes the game much more interesting.</p>
			<p>Made with the Godot game engine.</p>
			<p>Note: The game has a fixed aspect ratio, and was never intended to be played on mobile phones.</p>
