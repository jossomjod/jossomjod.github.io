			<h2>#2: A unique piano roll for making music.</h2>
			<p>Instead of traditional notes there are pitch automation nodes (represented by circles connected by lines). A single note can have many automation nodes.<br>
			The idea is to allow automating synth- and effect parameters for individual notes. Technically, you <i>can</i> do this in most existing DAWs, but you'd have to create a bunch of extra tracks, most of them with only a few notes each, and to make changes and additions you would have to scroll a hundred miles and click through a thousand menus.
			</p>
			<p>NOTE: This is an old prototype. It lacks many common features, such as saving/loading, undo/redo, etc, and there are known bugs. This prototype has served its purpose and will not be further developed.</p>
			<p><b>Instructions:</b></p>
			<p>Left-click on empty space to place a note. Notes consist of two or more nodes (circles) connected by lines. Left-click on a line to add a new node.<br>
			Left-click and drag to move a circle. The largest circle of a note moves the entire note.<br>
			Right-click on a node to delete it. Deleting an end-node deletes the entire note.<br>
			Press Space to play/stop.<br>
			Press Ctrl+Space to play from wherever the mouse cursor is.<br>
			Press 1 to switch to pitch automation mode (default)<br>
			Press 2 to switch to volume automation mode.<br>
			Press G to toggle snap to grid.<br>
			Press V to toggle only the vertical grid snapping.<br>
			Press H to toggle only the horizontal grid snapping.</p>

			<h2>#3: Tic-Tac-Two</h2>
			<p>It's like tic-tac-toe, but better.<br>
			Instead of placing new crosses or circles until someone wins, you place only three pieces each, then keep moving them, one by one, to new positions, until someone wins.<br>A simple rule-change that makes the game much more interesting.</p>
			<p>Made with the Godot game engine.</p>
			<p>Note: The game has a fixed aspect ratio, and was never intended to be played on mobile phones.</p>

			<h2>#4: JODSynth</h2>
			<p>An FM synth that doesn't have a <span class="crazy">crazy</span> wierd UI, so it can actually be used by humans.</p>
			<p>Ok, maybe it's a little <span class="crazy crazy2">crazy</span>, but it's not anywhere near as bad as Dexed :p</p>
			<p>And it's a work in progress. Both UI and functionality.</p>
			<p>
				You can play notes by pressing keys on the keyboard.<br>
				Z, X, C, V, etc are like the white keys on a piano.<br>
				S, D, G, H, J, etc are like the black keys.<br>
				Q, W, E, etc are an octave up from there.<br>
				You'll figure out the rest, I'm sure.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pageup/Pagedown changes the base octave.<br>
				Home/End adjusts the note offset<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				UPDATE: Now includes a <span class="dance">multi-track</span> piano roll,<br>
				which is much more betterer than the old Piano roll 2 <span class="roll">üòÅ</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Use F3 and F4 to toggle snapping to the grid.<br>
				Space to toggle playback, Ctrl + space to play from the cursor.<br>
				Ctrl + click and drag to select every note in an area.
			</p>
			<p>
				Clicking "Save" stores the current tracks and synths locally on your device under the name specified.<br>
				To load the saved data, type in that name and click "Load".<br>
				You can also quick-save / quick-load with F8 / F9<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				You may experience performance issues in Firefox.<br>Chrome and Edge should work fine.
